# JS and CSS snippets for injection
Written for personal use

# STOP
You probably don't want to load this directly from this repo.
This is meant for personal use and loading from this script will give me access to your browser data.
You shouldn't trust me with that.
If you know what you're doing, feel free to fork.


## Usage
- use any browser extension [eg](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) that supports injecting javasript to _all_ websites.
- use content of [loadscript.js](loadscript.js) to be injected to all pages. (confirm url)
